### Exercise 1
```{r ex1}
### For x = 3 and y = 15, compute the sum, difference, product and quotient of x and y

x <- 3
y <- 15
### sum
x + y
### difference
x - y
### product
x * y
### quotient
x/y
```


### Exercise 2
```{r ex2}
### For x = 2 and y = 3, Test x^5 is greater than y^4 and return a logical value
x <- 2
y <- 3
z = (x^5) > (y^4)
z
```

### Exercise 3
```{r ex3}
### Create a vector of the values 22, 62, 148, 43 and 129. Determine the sum of the vector. Divide each value in the vector by the sum to determine relate frequency.
vec <- c(22, 62, 148, 43, 129)
sum(vec)
vec/sum(vec)
```


### Exercise 4
```{r ex4}
### Create a vector of the nucleotides A, T, C and G. Sort the vector.
nuc <- c("A,T,C,G")
sort(nuc)
```
