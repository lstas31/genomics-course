```

### Create your own .Rmd file with the code from the examples. While you do this feel free to change or alter the code so that you understand what it is doing. Do the 1st exercises from each of the sections above. 

```{r}
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
```

# 14.3.1: Basic Match
```{r, basic_match}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")

#The next step up in complexity is ., which matches any character (except a newline):

str_view(x, ".a.")

# To create the regular expression, we need \\
dot <- "\\."

# But the expression itself only contains one:
writeLines(dot)

# And this tells R to look for an explicit .
x <- c("abc", "a.c", "bef")
str_view(x, "a\\.c")

x <- "a\\b"
writeLines(x)

str_view(x, "\\\\")
```

## 14.3.1.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise1}
# Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\"

# "\": used as an escape symbol in regular expressions

# "\\": in order to create the regular expression \. we use \\

# "\\\": to match an actual \ you need to write four backslashes to make one literal backslash
```

# 14.3.2: Anchor
```{r, anchor}
# use ^ to match the start of the string.
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a")


# use $ to match the end of the string.
str_view(x, "a$")

# mnemonic: If you begin with power (^), you end up with money ($).

# To force a regular expression to only match a complete string, anchor it with both ^ and $:
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
str_view(x, "apple")

str_view(x, "^apple$")
```

## 14.3.2.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise2}
# How would you match the literal string "$^$"?

str_view(c("$^$"), "^\\$\\^\\$$", match = TRUE)
```

# 14.3.3 Character classes and alternatives
```{r, charclass}
# \d : matches any digit.
# \s : matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
# [abc] : matches a, b, or c.
# [^abc] : matches anything except a, b, or c.

# Look for a literal character that normally has special meaning in a regex
x <- c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c")
str_view(x, "a[.]c")

str_view(x, ".[*]c")

str_view(x, "a[ ]")

x <- c("grey", "gray")
str_view(x, "gr(e|a)y")
```

## 14.3.3.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise3}
# Create regular expressions to find all words that:
# Start with a vowel.

str_subset(stringr::words, "^[aeiou]") %>% head

# That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)

str_view(stringr::words, "[aeiou]", match=FALSE)

# End with ed, but not with eed.

str_subset(stringr::words, "[^e]ed$")

# End with ing or ise.
str_subset(stringr::words, "(ing|ise)$")
```

# 14.3.4 Repetition
```{r, repetition}
# The next step up in power involves controlling how many times a pattern matches:
# ?: 0 or 1
# +: 1 or more
# *: 0 or more

x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")

str_view(x, "CC+")

str_view(x, 'C[LX]+')


# You can also specify the number of matches precisely:
# {n}: exactly n
# {n,}: at least n
# {,m}: at most m
# {n,m}: between n and m

str_view(x, "C{0,2}")

str_view(x, "C{2,}")

# make matches “lazy”, by matching the shortest string possible by putting a ? after them
str_view(x, 'C{2,3}?')

str_view(x, 'C[LX]+?')

```

## 14.3.4.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise4}
# Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form.

# ?: {0,1}
str_view(x, "C{0,1}")
str_view(x, 'C{0,1}?')

# +: {1,}
str_view(x, "C{1,}")
str_view(x, "C+")

# *: {0,}
str_view(x, "C{0,}")
str_view(x, "C*")
```

# 14.3.5 Grouping and backreferences
```{r, grouping}
# The following regular expression finds all fruits that have a repeated pair of letters.
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```

## 14.3.5.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise5}
#Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:
# (.)\1\1
## character that appears three time in a row

# "(.)(.)\\2\\1"
## a palindrome

# (..)\1
## two characters that are repeated in a row

# "(.).\\1.\\1"
## character followed by any character, the original character, any other character, the original character again


# "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"
## three characters followed by zero or more characters of any kind followed by the same three characters but in reverse order
```

# 14.4 Tools
## 14.4.1 Detect matches
```{r, detect}
# Note the below takes advantage of the built in word vector that is loaded with the stringr library.

# To determine if a character vector matches a pattern, use str_detect(). It returns a logical vector the same length as the input:
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_detect(x, "e")

# How many common words start with t?
sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))

# What proportion of common words end with a vowel?
mean(str_detect(words, "[aeiou]$"))

# Find all words containing at least one vowel, and negate
no_vowels_1 <- !str_detect(words, "[aeiou]")

# Find all words consisting only of consonants (non-vowels)
no_vowels_2 <- str_detect(words, "^[^aeiou]+$")
identical(no_vowels_1, no_vowels_2)

# A common use of str_detect() is to select the elements that match a pattern. You can do this with logical subsetting, or the convenient str_subset() wrapper:
words[str_detect(words, "x$")]
# or
str_subset(words, "x$")

# Typically, however, your strings will be one column of a data frame, and you’ll want to use filter instead:
df <- tibble(
  word = words, 
  i = seq_along(word)
)
df %>% 
  filter(str_detect(word, "x$"))

# A variation on str_detect() is str_count(): rather than a simple yes or no, it tells you how many matches there are in a string:
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_count(x, "a")

# On average, how many vowels per word?
mean(str_count(words, "[aeiou]"))

# Use str_count() with mutate():
df %>% 
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    consonants = str_count(word, "[^aeiou]")
  )

# counting
str_count("abababa", "aba")
# viewing
str_view_all("abababa", "aba")
```
## 14.4.1.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise6}
#For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls.
#Find all words that start or end with x.
str_subset(words, "^x|x$")

#Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
str_subset(words, "^[aeiou].*[^aeiou]$") %>% head
```

# 14.4.2 Extract matches
```{r, extract}
# To extract the actual text of a match, use str_extract(). We use the Harvard sentences.
length(sentences)

head(sentences)

# Imagine we want to find all sentences that contain a colour. We first create a vector of colour names, and then turn it into a single regular expression:

colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
colour_match

# Now we can select the sentences that contain a colour, and then extract the colour to figure out which one it is:
has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, colour_match)
matches <- str_extract(has_colour, colour_match)
head(matches)

head(has_colour)
# some of the sentences have 2 colors in them!

# Improve this using
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more, colour_match)

str_extract(more, colour_match)

# as a list:
str_extract_all(more, colour_match)

# If you use simplify = TRUE, str_extract_all() will return a matrix with short matches expanded to the same length as the longest:
str_extract_all(more, colour_match, simplify = TRUE)

x <- c("a", "a b", "a b c")
str_extract_all(x, "[a-z]", simplify = TRUE)
```

## 14.4.2.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise7}
# In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem.

colour_matches <- str_c("\\b(", str_c(colours, collapse = "|"), ")\\b")

more2 <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more2, colour_matches)
# without the sentence: "The green light in the brown box flickered." since it only contains 1 colour
more2 <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_matches) > 1]
str_view_all(more2, colour_matches)
str_extract(more2, colour_matches)

```

# 14.4.3 Grouped matches
```{r, gorupmatches}
# You can also use parentheses to extract parts of a complex match. 

# We’ll look for any word that comes after “a” or “the”. Defining a “word” in a regular expression is a little tricky, so here I use a simple approximation: a sequence of at least one character that isn’t a space.
noun <- "(a|the) ([^ ]+)"

has_noun <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(noun) %>%
  head(10)
has_noun %>% 
  str_extract(noun)

# str_extract() gives us the complete match; str_match() gives each individual component. Instead of a character vector, it returns a matrix, with one column for the complete match followed by one column for each group:
has_noun %>% 
  str_match(noun)

# If your data is in a tibble, it’s often easier to use tidyr::extract(). It works like str_match() but requires you to name the matches, which are then placed in new columns:
tibble(sentence = sentences) %>% 
  tidyr::extract(
    sentence, c("article", "noun"), "(a|the) ([^ ]+)", 
    remove = FALSE
  )

# Like str_extract(), if you want all matches for each string, you’ll need str_match_all().
```

## 14.4.3.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise8}
# Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word.
numbers1 <- "\\b(one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten) +(\\w+)"

sentences[str_detect(sentences, numbers1)] %>%
  str_extract(numbers1)
```
# 14.4.4 Replacing matches
```{r, replacematch}
# str_replace() and str_replace_all() allow you to replace matches with new strings. The simplest use is to replace a pattern with a fixed string:

x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-")

str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")


# With str_replace_all() you can perform multiple replacements by supplying a named vector:

x <- c("1 house", "2 cars", "3 people")
str_replace_all(x, c("1" = "one", "2" = "two", "3" = "three"))

# Instead of replacing with a fixed string you can use backreferences to insert components of the match. In the following code, I flip the order of the second and third words.

sentences %>% 
  str_replace("([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+)", "\\1 \\3 \\2") %>% 
  head(5)
```

## 14.4.4.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise9}
# Replace all forward slashes in a string with backslashes.

str_replace_all("breakfast/lunch/dinner", "/", "\\\\")
```

# 14.4.5 Splitting
```{r, splitting}
# Use str_split() to split a string up into pieces. For example, we could split sentences into words:

sentences %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  str_split(" ")

# extracting the frst element of the list
"a|b|c|d" %>% 
  str_split("\\|") %>% 
  .[[1]]

#Otherwise, like the other stringr functions that return a list, you can use simplify = TRUE to return a matrix:
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  str_split(" ", simplify = TRUE)

# You can also request a maximum number of pieces:

fields <- c("Name: Lorene", "Country: USA", "Age: 21")
fields %>% str_split(": ", n = 2, simplify = TRUE)

# Instead of splitting up strings by patterns, you can also split up by character, line, sentence and word boundary()s:
x <- "This is a sentence.  This is another sentence."
str_view_all(x, boundary("word"))

str_split(x, " ")[[1]]

str_split(x, boundary("word"))[[1]]
```

## 14.4.5.1 Exercises
```{r, exercise10}
# Split up a string like “apples, pears, and bananas” into individual components.

y <- "apples, pears, and bananas."
str_view_all(y, boundary("word"))
```
